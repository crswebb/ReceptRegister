# ReceptRegister

ReceptRegister is your personal, searchable index for pastry recipes from your book collection. Instead of flipping through sticky notes and indexes, you can find the right recipe in seconds and jump straight to the page.

## What you can store
- Recipe name (e.g., “Kanelbullar”)
- Book title (which book it comes from)
- Page number (where to find it in the book)
- Categories (one or more, like “Buns”, “Cookies”, “Swedish”)
- Keywords (one or more, like “cardamom”, “chocolate”, “gluten-free”)
- Tried checkbox (mark whether you’ve baked it yet)

## What you can do
- Search by name, book, category, or keyword.
- Quickly see the exact page number in the right book.
- Filter by “tried” or “not tried” to plan your next bake.
- Browse by book or category when you’re in the mood for a certain style.
- Update entries as you explore your library.

## How it feels to use
- A simple search bar to find recipes by words you remember.
- Clear filters for book, category, and tried status.
- A tidy list showing: Name • Book • Page • Categories • Tried.
- A focused details view to review and edit a recipe’s information.

## Everyday examples
- Type “cardamom” to find every recipe with that flavor.
- Filter by “Buns” to plan a fika spread.
- Look up “Bröd och Bageri” and jump to page 123.
- Show only “not tried” recipes to pick your next bake.

## Why it’s helpful
Your shelves stay beautiful, your pages stay clean, and your baking time goes into actual baking—not searching. Think of it as the well‑labeled spice rack for your recipe books.

## Security and access
- The app is protected with a password.  
- On first visit, if no password has been set yet, you’ll be guided to create one.  
- After that, you’ll sign in before you can use the app.  
- If you ever forget the password, the site administrator can clear the saved password value in the database to enable the “set a new password” screen again.

## Future ideas
- Import from a simple spreadsheet to add many recipes at once.
- Mark favorites or add a quick rating.
- Add personal notes and tips you discover while baking.
- Attach photos of results for inspiration.
- Print or share a shortlist when planning a baking day.
